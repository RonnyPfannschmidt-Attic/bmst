## Project Govenance




### Contribution Handling

Contributions will be accepted by means of the C4.2 Protocol.


### Community Behaviour

The Project will implement recent versions of the Contributors Covenant to deal with behaviour.
Community Administratos MUST coordinate its enforcement.


### Community Administrators

* @RonnyPfannshcmidt

### Committers

* @RonnyPfannschmidt

### Project infancy consideration

Until the project has enough commiters to follow C4, pull requests by the sole commiter will have to be merged by the sole commiter.
